    What happens:
        Validates session exists and game is not over.
        Checks if there's already an active contract (can't negotiate if one exists).
        Saves any previous negotiation to history before starting new one.
        Clears previous negotiation state (chat history, draft contract).
        Stores the initial contract type (cannot be changed during negotiation).
        Validates proposal against negotiation config (length ranges, cap types, etc.).
        Builds a Contract object from the proposal.
        Evaluates proposal using AI (accept or reject only, no counters).
        If accepted: makes contract active, saves negotiation to history, clears negotiation state.
        If rejected: adds rejection message to chat history, allows student to enter chat.
